Surprisingly no better than my last Cookie Clicker, potentially worse.
Started off the week feeling really positive about React, ended with a headache.

I can understand and use the code from the workshops to get my Cookie Clicker to do what I have done this week, but anything further than that I've found it almost impossible. Spend a couple evenings just trying to get the CookiesPerSecond and the CookieClick to go in the same value, couldn't even get close to it.

Beginning of the week was passing props perfectly tried doing it in this example, tried every which way possible to no success. Googled it, tested, nothing.

Found some workshops difficult to apply to my homework as it was all done in the App.jsx, then when it comes to applying these in a serperate components and importing I got no where.

I found myself going back to the beginning, which is why I am left what I have, anything else I tried doing just left me unable to see anything due to an error.

All I'm left to style with is an image, and some text.
I try to style the API text, doesn't go to plan.
